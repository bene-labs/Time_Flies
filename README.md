Time flies when your life only lasts one minute. Try to steal as much food as possible to nuture your offspring but don't let the mean baby wasps get in the way!

Different flies will spawn depending on what types of food you eat. Gotta hatch them all!


The themes for the game jam were: one minute, killing time & life as currency.
